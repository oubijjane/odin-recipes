    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of the more famous sandwiches straight out of the island of Cuba. This recipe came from my uncle who
        used to work at a restaurant in Pinar del Rio, Cuba and now works at a Cuban cafeteria here in Miami. This
        sandwich is best served with fried plantain chips and a cold mamey milkshake!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sweet bread rolls</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup prepared mustard</li>
        <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
        <li>1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork</li>
        <li>1 pound sliced Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup dill pickle slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>split the sandwich rolls in half, and spread mustard
            <br> and mayonnaise liberally onto the cut sides.
        </li>
        <li>On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham <br>
            and pork in exactly that order. Place a few pickles onto each one,<br>
            and put the top of the roll onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with<br>
            melted butter.</li>
        <li>Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high<br>
            heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet<br>
            over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy<br>
            plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this also. Cook<br>
            for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If using a skillet,<br>
            you may want to flip them once for even browning.</li>
        <li>Slice diagonally and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
